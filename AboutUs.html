  ABOUT US</h1>
  <p id="desc">
  D'Relax Resort is an area renowned for its natural beauty and rich flora, fauna and marine life.  The accommodation was constructed to nestle in between the property's many trees,<br> none of which were cut during the process, in order to blend seamlessly with the natural surroundings.<br> With the resort's low-key approach to building, the habitat of the area's many varieties of birds and animals was not disturbed. <br>
  In addition, we employ a number of practices to reduce the negative impact on our surroundings with a focus on sustainable water and waste management as well as energy efficiency.

        When the resort was built more than two decades ago, it was with the idea of living in balance <br> within this unique environment. Originally built as a private home, the building has served as a <br> training facility for the local community and there was once even a mill house on the land.Its past <br> is colourful and varied with a myriad of tales to tell from Members of Parliament, Artists, <br> Entertainers and Royalty who have all walked through its doors.
